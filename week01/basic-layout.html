                <p>
                    My name is Jéssica Seniw, and I am from southern Brazil. I currently work at Engemon, where I
                    develop responsibility, organization, and teamwork skills. I am also a Software Development student
                    through BYU-Pathway Worldwide with BYU-Idaho, and I am constantly improving my knowledge in
                    programming and web development.
                    <br><br>
                    I enjoy learning new technologies, creating web projects, and solving problems using logical
                    thinking. In my free time, I like organizing my goals, studying English, and improving my
                    professional skills. My goal is to continue growing in the technology field and build a solid career
                    in software development.
